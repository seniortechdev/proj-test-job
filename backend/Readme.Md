## Requirements

* Node 14
* Git

Without any changes, this app is connected to a Contentful space with read-only access. To experience the full end-to-end Contentful experience, you need to connect the app to a Contentful space with read _and_ write access. This enables you to see how content editing in the Contentful web app works and how content changes propagate to this app.

## Common setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone **
cd the-example-app.nodejs
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Steps for read-only access

To start the express server, run the following

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:2500](http://localhost:2500) and take a look around.


## Steps for read and write access (recommended)

Step 1: Add ENV 


Step 2: To start the express server, run the following
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## Use Docker
You can also run this app as a Docker container:

Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs.git
```

Step 2: Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t the-example-app.nodejs .
```

Step 3: Run the Docker container locally:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d the-example-app.nodejs
```

If you docker build -f Dockerfile -t server .
docker run -it -p 2500:2500 server
